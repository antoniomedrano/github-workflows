## Forking / Cloning  
Contributing to a repo if you are not an existing contributor  

*Early draft: brainstorming the solution*

* Clone via command line -or- Fork on GitHub (then use clone to get everything local)
* Create a new branch
* Make changes
* Make local commit
* Sync branch to GitHub
* Do a pull request to the original project
