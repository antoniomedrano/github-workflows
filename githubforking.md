<strong>Contributing to an Open Source Project</strong>  
*(when you are not already an assigned collaborator)*

A combined GitHub / local command line approach

to do:  
* note: this is a preliminary draft... not even close to finished.
* write an outline of fork/clone steps (consider a few use cases)
* describe steps in sentence/narrative form
* QA/QC

This document describes two different workflows to fork and/or clone an existing project-- allowing you to contribute your own materials to the repo and submit the changes back to someone else's open source project.  

*Note:* When a project is cloned or forked in GitHub, the default settings are for your changes to be resubmitted back to the original project repo (not just your versions). However, there may be cases when you do not want to submit your changes back to the original repo. For instance, in the geospatial industry, some repositories are offered as templates for creating your own map. Your changes are not improvements to the original project, but rather personal customizations. If that is the case, GitHub has a special import function. Using http://import.github.com, a repository will be copied to your GitHub account, but your changes will not automatically be sent back to the original project.
