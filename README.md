# GitHub Workflows  
Common GitHub / version control workflows.  

*Existing doc:*
* [githubcommand.md](../master/githubcommand.md) -- integrating the git command line with the GitHub workflow

*To do:*   
* document how to make additions to an open source project by forking it, making changes, and then submitting changes back to the original project. Use reference: GitHub Bootcamp [documentation on forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). With respect to the command line, see: [stackoverflow fork vs clone](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6286571/git-fork-is-git-clone). Since the *fork* concept does not translate directly to git, probably the most straightforward workflow would be to: "fork" the repo in the GitHub UI, this gives you a linked clone on your GitHub account. Clone your version onto your machine and make changes. A commit would then need to progress from your local version to your GitHub repo via a Pull Request. Then, you would make a Pull Request from your GitHub repo to the original project's repo.
