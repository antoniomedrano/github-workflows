# GitHub Workflows  
The plan is to document my various Github / version control workflows.  

*Existing doc:*
* githubcommand.md -- integrating the git command line with the GitHub workflow

*To do:*   
* document how to make additions to an open source project by forking it, making changes, and then submitting changes back to the original project. Use reference: Github bootcamp [documentation on forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
